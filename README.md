### DuolingoTreeEnhancer stopped working, HELP!

In September 2017, Duolingo implemented a [new look for lessons on the website](https://www.duolingo.com/comment/24513744),
and started deploying it slowly. If you are not in the group of users that are using the new website,
the latest update **won't work for you**.

If that's your case, you can [reinstall version 0.9.9](https://github.com/camiloaa/duolingotreeenhancer/raw/OldUI/DuolingoTreeEnhancer.user.js).
It won't auto-update anymore until the new site is deployed for all users.
If you get the new design before that, just use the link in the Installation section again.
